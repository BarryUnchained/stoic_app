# stoic_app

A new Flutter project.

## Runtime Configuration

Supabase credentials must be provided at runtime with `--dart-define`.

```bash
flutter run \
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url \
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

`.env` is no longer loaded from Flutter assets and should never be committed.
